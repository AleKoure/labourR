Description: Statistical analysis and processing of data related
    to skills, competences, qualifications and occupations provide
    useful insight to policy-makers, education and 
    training providers, employment services, guidance practitioners, 
    researchers and citizens.  We introduce a suite of methods and 
    data sets to address these problems. The package allows researchers to 
    map free text to a broad range of standardized classifications, providing 
    a user-friendly tool for exploring labour market data.
